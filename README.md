### Specifications
 Design the VHDL description of a matrix multiplier with the following characteristics: 
-input matrices of size (NxM) and (MxP) with elements represented in 2’s complement on 4 bits 
-Output matrix of size (NxP) with elements represented in 2’s complement on Q bits. The value of Q has to be determined in order to avoid any finite arithmetic’s error.
