# Electronics Systems Project - Matrix Multiplier in VHDL
Electronics Systems course project (MSc in Computer Engineering @ University of Pisa). The goal of the project is to produce the Design, Simulation and Synthesis of a Matrix Multiplier in VHDL. In addition, a Python program is provided for the purpose of dynamically generating different testbench files.

## Project Specifications
 Design the VHDL description of a matrix multiplier with the following characteristics: 
- input matrices of size (NxM) and (MxP) with elements represented in 2’s complement on 4 bits;
- Output matrix of size (NxP) with elements represented in 2’s complement on Q bits. The value of Q has to be determined in order to avoid any finite arithmetic’s error.
